                <h1>DYRROTH PRINCE OF THE ABYSS</h1>
                <p>
                    Thirty years ago, a prince was born in the Moniyan Empire. He was a symbol of salvation and justice
                    for
                    his people. It was believed that he would lead the Moniyan Empire in unifying the Land of Dawn. The
                    Empire Nobles gave everything to the prince.

                    On the day of prince's first birthday[,] he was found dead in his baby bed blanketed in blood. The
                    room
                    was covered with claw marks and the guards in charge of protecting the prince were also found dead.
                    Sorrow covered with claw marks and the guards in charge of protecting the prince were also found
                    dead.
                    Sorrow engulfed the whole Moniyan Empire. The hope of the Empire had fallen and, to this day, there
                    has
                    never been such an inspiring prince. Some people believed the prince was killed by the Demons, while
                    others still hoped the Prince was alive. The Empire Nobles appointed the Imperial Knights and the
                    Monastery of Light to find out the truth. At the same time, the Son of Darkness was "born" tooâ€¦

                    After several years, something strange appeared in the Southern Hills of the Moniyan Empire. In the
                    deepest part of the Abyss, Thamuz, the Lord Lava, watched a special battle. In this glorious battle,
                    the
                    monsters fought with each other until the strongest emerged. He not only possessed the best Evil
                    Gene
                    but also proved to be the strongest fighter in the Demons.

                    Alice embraced the beloved fighter and recalled the "Royal Plan" that she had carried out. He was a
                    masterpiece for her. He mastered Alice's trick, deception, and military strategy. He also learned
                    combat
                    from Thamuz. Now, the Son of Darkness is a capable assistant for the Abyss. He will represent the
                    Lord
                    of the Abyss, fighting against the Moniyan Empire, implementing the "Dawn Plan", and destroying the
                    "Shining Spark" of the Empire.
